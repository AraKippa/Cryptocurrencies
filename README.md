# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised ML

This data was pretty enlightening to me, as I know next to nothing about crypto.  I did suspect a few things and this data confirmed them. It looks as though most crypto data is pretty worthless with just a few high performing outliers driving the frenzy.  For this code, given it's subject matter, I would suggest some levels of automation be built in to improve it.  This is because the crypto market seems to fluctuate quite wildly at times, and adding automation, could held keep these values up to date in a more timely fashion.
